## Getting Started

### Running the Development Server

1. Activate your virtual environment (if using one):
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Unix/macOS
   venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows
   ```

2. Start the Django development server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

3. The server will start at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`

Note: Make sure you have all dependencies installed and migrations applied before running the server.
